# Loops With Counters
Many job operations have consistent methods to break out of of the loop once a condition is met, however, there can be many instances where breaking out a loop prior to that condition makes more sense. In Tines, we can introduce a 'Counter' which the workflow can increment and use in order to break out of the loop on the chance that the condition being met isn't available in a timely manner.
